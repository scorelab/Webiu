  mainText:
    The SCoRe Lab has conducted research covering various aspects of sensor networks, embeded systems, digital forensic, information security, mobile applications, cloud, blockchain and software tools. The goal of our research is to generate computing solutions through identifying low cost methodologies and strategies that lead to sustainability.At present, the SCoRe group is at a stage of its evolution in which it has been able to secure high donor confidence as evidenced by simultaneous foreign funded projects. SCoRe group studies and produces sustainable computing solutions with respect to low cost computing and communication foundations in the developing and emerging regions in the world. We have developed several affordable and sustainable ICT solutions specially focusing the requirements in the developing region. These solutions are briefly described in the projects section.

    - title: Bassa
      description:
        Bassa is automated Download Queue for Enterprise to take the best use of Internet bandwidth. It solves the problem of wasting internet bandwidth by queuing a download if it is larger than a given threshold value in high traffic and when the traffic is low, it completes the download of the files.
